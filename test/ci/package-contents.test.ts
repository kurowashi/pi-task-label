/**
 * Contract: `npm pack` ships exactly what the manifest promises, no more.
 *
 * The tarball is what a user's machine actually loads, so this reads the
 * `files` whitelist and the `pi.extensions` entries from package.json instead
 * of restating them here. A whitelist edit that is wrong now fails in CI.
 *
 * `--ignore-scripts` keeps the check side-effect free. The package ships no
 * lifecycle scripts: git installs run `npm install --omit=dev`, where hook
 * installation would fail because devDependencies are absent.
